# OASIS-filter
## application:
While using affective image database, it would turn into a tثdious work to find each peacture according to its normative ratings (affective dimensions like valence and arousal), listed in a information sheet. I wrote a code to do so without beeing required to select each picture individually; simply put, you can select the interval on a graph depicting circumplex space  which would define your subcategory of images) and by selecting a folder, this code would copy all of those images to this folder as well as renaming them to your desirable list of names (e.g. f1,...,fn)

## Add or  modify in the current code:
- add another measure to categories based on person, object, . ..
- we neeed 2 versions of the code: 1- with **GUI** 2- without it 

## How to use it:
Run each file and follow 5 main steps described in figure-1.

</p>

## To modify:
change the caption for figure to : 'Image ratings in circumplex space, with valence (measured on a 1–7 Likert scale) on the x-axis and arousal (also measured on a 1–7 Likert
scale) on the y-axis'
