# OASIS-filter

## Application
While using affective image database, it would turn into tedious work to find each picture according to its normative ratings (affective dimensions like valence and arousal), listed in an information sheet. I wrote a code to do so without being required to select each picture individually; simply put, you can select the interval on a graph (fig1.depicting circumplex space  which would define your subcategory of images) and by selecting a folder, this code would copy all of those images to this folder as well as renaming them to your desirable list of names (e.g. f1,..., fn)

## Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS)
Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS), is an open-access online stimulus set containing 900 color images depicting a broad spectrum of themes, including humans, animals, objects, and scenes, along with normative ratings on two affective dimensionsâ€”valence (i.e., the degree of positive or negative affective response that the image evokes) and arousal (i.e., the intensity of the affective response that the image evokes). The OASIS images, along with normative valence and arousal ratings, are available for download from https://osf.io/6pnd7/ or www.benedekkurdi.com/#oasis. [^fn1]

## How to use it
Run each file and follow the 5 main steps described in figure-2.

## To modify
- Add another measure to categories based on person, object, . ..
- We need 2 versions of the code: 1- with **GUI** 2- without it
