# OASIS-filter
## application
While using image dataset it would turn into a tidious work to find each peacture according to its labels (parameters like valence and arousal), listed in a information sheet. I wrote a code to do so without beeing required to select each picture individually, now you can define (set) some characteristics for your aimed subcategory of images and by selecting a folder, this code would copy all of those images to this folder as well as renaming them to your desirable list of names (e.g. f1,...,fn)
## Add or  modify in the current code:
- add dalogbox to open the directory ond find .csv file defining the information of oasis images
- this code was written for windows, it can be develope for other OSs
- for both directories (image source and final image) add a description to tha pop up file 
- add another measure to categories based on person, object, . ..
- we neeed 2 version of the coded: 1- wit **GUI** 2- without it
