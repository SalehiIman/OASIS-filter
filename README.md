# OASIS-filter
## application:
While using image dataset it would turn into a tidious work to find each peacture according to its labels (parameters like valence and arousal), listed in a information sheet. I wrote a code to do so without beeing required to select each picture individually, now you can define (set) some characteristics for your aimed subcategory of images and by selecting a folder, this code would copy all of those images to this folder as well as renaming them to your desirable list of names (e.g. f1,...,fn)
## Add or  modify in the current code:
- add another measure to categories based on person, object, . ..
- we neeed 2 versions of the code: 1- with **GUI** 2- without it 

## How to use it:
